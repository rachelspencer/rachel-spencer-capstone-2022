# Cairns Travel App 

Have you visited Cairns? This regional town is positioned in the 'Far North' of Queensland in Australia and is often refered to a FNQ Cairns. 
Cairns is the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) which is one of the most famous natural wonders of the world. The GBR is the largest coral reef system, stretching over 1,430m (2,300km)
along the northeast coast of Australia. Sounds good? Its gets better! The Daintree Rainforest, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is also at the footstep of Cairns. The Daintree is one of 
the oldest rainforests on Earth, estimated to be around 180 million years old. Both of the natural wonders contribute to Cairns being a popular destination for nature lovers and adventure seekers. 

This app is designed to assist travelers who are planning to visit Cairns. It not only lists some pretty cool adventure activities, but it is also an inventory for restuarants, bars and 'must tries' to do in Cairns. 
I was born and raised in this tropical paradise, so I am leaking some secret local knowledge here (ðŸ¤«).
