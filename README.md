# Explore Cairns

First a bit about Cairns, Australia
Have you visited Cairns? This regional town is positioned in the 'Far North' of Queensland in Australia and is often refered to a FNQ Cairns. 
Cairns is the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) which is one of the most famous natural wonders of the world. The GBR is the largest coral reef system, stretching over 1,430m (2,300km)
along the northeast coast of Australia. Sounds good? Its gets better! The Daintree Rainforest, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is also at the footstep of Cairns. The Daintree is one of 
the oldest rainforests on Earth, estimated to be around 180 million years old. Both of the natural wonders contribute to Cairns being a popular destination for nature lovers and adventure seekers. 

What does this app do?
This app is designed to assist travelers who are planning to visit Cairns. It comes pre-loaded with cards that list adventure activities, restuarants, bars and 'must tries' to do in Cairns. 
I was born and raised in this tropical paradise, so I am leaking some secret local knowledge here (ðŸ¤«). The app has functionality for the user to add more items. If the user has completed an 
item, they can mark it off as done. Here's some screenshots to elaborate...


## Watch the demo video!
*Note I am activily working on this README.md, so stay tuned for more info on how to use it!

## How it works
Adding an item
1. Visit wwww.visitingcairns.com
2. Mouse click on either "Activities", "Food and Bev", or "Must-tries". For this example we'll enter through "Activities".

As mentioned, this app comes pre-loaded with data, but you can also add do its inventory. The next steps will outline how to add another activity, the steps are the same for the other two pages.
3. Enter a title for the activity, the name of who recommebded the activity, and then a url link for an image associated with this activity. After, mouse click on "Add". The new activity will appear at the bottom.

Making off an item
On every item card there is a "Been there, done that" section with a toggle switch. Once an item has been done, the user can click this toggle to indicate this status. I'll demonstrate this
from the Must-tries page.
Toggle before:

Toggle after:

Deleting an item
On every item card there is a `x` button. Clicking this will delete the item card.

## Installation
`npm` is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer. You can install Node by [downloading it from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
or using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on a macOS or Linux device or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) on a Windows device.

You can check if you have it already installed by running `node -v` in your terminal. You will need it for this project to run, so don't skip this!

You will also need to make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed, check by running `code --version`. If you don't have it [download it from VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). If you use another development 
environment, you will need to alter setp 7. to open the cloned repo. 

### Clone the project locally
1. Click on the "Code" tab on this repo's "Code" page.
2. Click the green "Code" button to reveal a "Clone" popup.
3. The "HTTPS" tab should be automatically selected. If not, click "HTTPS."
4. Click the copy button to copy the url of this repository to your clipboard.
![Clone the repo](https://github.com/rachelspencer/rachel-spencer-capstone-2022/assets/111473039/b1287181-7a81-4abf-9520-4e5989d7e4a3)

5. Open your terminal and cd to the directory where you want this project to live.

6. Once you have successfully navigated to the directory, run git clone and paste the the web URL right after (copied to your clipboard in step four).

7. In the terminal, run `ls` to determine you can see all the files associated with this directory. Once you are ready to open the project run `code .`.
<img width="783" alt="Run code" src="https://github.com/rachelspencer/rachel-spencer-capstone-2022/assets/111473039/71a46a3d-6065-463e-8cfe-213df10f8112">

8. In the terminal run `npm i` to install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file for this project.
<img width="756" alt="Run npm i" src="https://github.com/rachelspencer/rachel-spencer-capstone-2022/assets/111473039/707a73c6-c7de-4240-b70a-e8e3c0979b32">

The project is now cloned locally, but before you can run `npm start` you will need to set up a local `.env` file and add some environment variables. 

### Usage
Creating your `.env` file
In the root of the project, create a `.env` file. You will need to add three items here:
1. PORT=4005
2. URI=
3. NODE_ENV=development

NODE_ENV must be set to `development` and set the `PORT` variable to `4005`. The `URI` can be replaced with a postgresql database connection string. 

Once you have your `.env` file created you can follow these steps to use the project locally:
1. Run the application: `npm start`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4005`
